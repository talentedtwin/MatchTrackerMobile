# Add Team Screen Implementation

## Overview

Created a dedicated `AddTeamScreen` for adding and editing teams, providing a better user experience than the previous modal approach.

## Files Created

### `src/screens/AddTeamScreen.js`
A full-screen form for creating and editing teams with:
- **Team Name Input**: Text input with validation (2-50 characters required)
- **Real-time Validation**: Shows errors as user types
- **Helper Text**: Guidance for users
- **Info Box**: Explains the purpose of teams
- **Icon Integration**: Uses Ionicons throughout for consistent UI
- **Loading States**: Shows activity indicator during save
- **Edit Mode**: Supports both adding new teams and editing existing ones

## Features

### Form Validation
- Team name is required
- Minimum 2 characters
- Maximum 50 characters
- Real-time error display
- Input highlighting on error

### User Experience
- Clean, professional form design
- Helpful information box explaining teams
- Consistent with other screens (AddMatchScreen, EditMatchScreen)
- Loading state with disabled button
- Success/error alerts

### Navigation
- Accessed from Players screen "Add Team" button
- Edit mode accessed by tapping edit icon on team card
- Returns to Players screen after successful save

## Navigation Flow

```
PlayersScreen 
  → [+ Add Team] → AddTeamScreen → Save → PlayersScreen
  → [Edit Icon on Team] → AddTeamScreen (edit mode) → Update → PlayersScreen
```

## Schema Compliance

The screen works with the existing Team schema:

```prisma
model Team {
  id        String    @id @default(cuid())
  name      String    // ← Captured by form
  isDeleted Boolean   @default(false)
  deletedAt DateTime?
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
  userId    String    // ← Auto-added by backend
  matches   Match[]
  players   Player[]
  user      User      @relation(...)
}
```

## Changes to Existing Files

### `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js`
- Added import for `AddTeamScreen`
- Added stack screen route for 'AddTeam'

### `src/screens/PlayersScreen.js`
- Updated "Add Team" button to navigate to AddTeamScreen instead of opening modal
- Updated team edit icon to navigate to AddTeamScreen with team data
- Added `navigation` prop to component

### `src/screens/index.js`
- Added export for `AddTeamScreen`

## Usage Examples

navigation.navigate('AddTeam');
```

```
